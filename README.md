Guestbook
Are you familiar with the early web? Well if you're answer is NO you'll be excited to learn about one of the most popular website features on the web back then: Guestbooks!

A guestbook is a simple page on a website that allows any visitor to leave their name and a comment to the website's author.

Your task is to create a small Guestbook Service and deploy it.
